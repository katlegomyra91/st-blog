## About ST Blog

This blog is developed to showcase some of my Laravel and Angular skills.

The project is divided into 2 smaller projects and they will both need to be deployed in order for the blog application to work.

### Steps to run ST Blog application
1) set up Database using the db.sql file.
2) set up the .env file with the database details.
3) run the blog-api.
4) copy the URL (with the port number) and setup the settings file on Angular with it.
5) run Angular app.
